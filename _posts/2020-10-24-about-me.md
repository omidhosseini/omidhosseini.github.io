Hi there!

My name is Omid and I'm 31yrs old, It's been more than 7yrs that I've been programming. I started from the win-form project, but I decided to focus more on web programming. I wrote my first web programming in freelance. It was a simple content management system(cms). After that project, I wrote a web application that included all the pieces of information relating jobs in my hometown called LavasanDatabase(lavasan.biz), in this case, I wrote both sides of the project, restful web API  for back-end and angularjs for the dashboard, I also wrote the mobile application for that for two platforms Android and iOS, so I little bit learnt java and swift =), that was an amazing experience. In the past years till now, I was working in many positions such as front-end, back-end, sometimes full-stack, and now I'm focusing on back-end development.

I finally decided to create a personal blog to write about my experience and also include my daily lifestyle as well, so this way I can go through the stuff I posted on my blog to improve my skills and gain more experience, so please feel free to give me your valuable feedback.
